### **nostr FAQ**

###### **ðŸ¤™ What is nostr?**

Nostr ( [Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays](https://nostr.com) ) is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

[

###### **ðŸ¤™ What is a relay?**

]

[Nostr Relays](https://nostr.net.in) are like the backend servers for Nostr. They allow Nostr clients to send them messages, and they may (or may not) store those messages and broadcast those messages to all other connected clients. Connect to first [nostr relay server in India](https://nostr.net.in).

###### **ðŸ¤™ How I can start using nostr ?**

You will access Nostr (the protocol) via a client. Clients can be web, desktop, or mobile apps. Clients can fetch data from relays and also generate new data and push that to relays so others can read.Â
